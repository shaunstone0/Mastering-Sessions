## Mastering Sessions

This application is built with Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB. It is my first attempt at using sessions to authenticate users. 

`clone` repository and then `npm install` to get dependencies. `npm run dev` to run project with concurrently. 

Any feedback on the project appreciated.
